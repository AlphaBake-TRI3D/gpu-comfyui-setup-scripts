assumes you are in a cloud vm where root path is /home/ubuntu
and you cloned  gpu-comfyui-setup-scripts 

cd gpu-comfyui-setup-scripts/install_scripts
cp .env_sample to .env && fill in the credentials depending on where you need to download from 
bash full-setup.sh abc.xyz.com ( need to connect the IP in you dns management portal)

cd ~/ComfyUI 
source venv/bin/activate
python main.py --port 3000 ( this is nginx forwared to 80)

You would want to customise repos.txt and download-comfyui-models.sh for getting your workflows running
